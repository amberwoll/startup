  "description": "In shade seeker, you identify which of 4 squares is a different color from the rest. 4 squares of a random color are always on the screen, with 3 of them the same color. The 4th is a slightly off shade. If the user chooses the right (\"wrong\") shade, they're given a new random color, yet again with one different square, only this time they're even more similar than before. The levels get harder and harder. Beat the high score!  ## Key Features ### Game The game includes the main 4 squares that change color with every click and a high score box that resets whenever a wrong color is chosen and increments by one whenever a correct color is chosen. This box turns red before resetting so a player can know they made a mistake. ### Leaderboard The leaderboard updates with the highest score of global players and includes the top 10 high scores. In the background of the leaderboard is a leaderboard image. ### High Score Boxes The global and personal high score boxes are updated with their respective high scores. The personal high score can only be updated if the player is logged in. These are off to the right of the game. These are updated using JavaScript. ### Login Page The login page takes a player's username and password then gives additional access to seeing one's own high score on the main page. It also allows the user to make it on the global leaderboard if they beat the global high score. ### Help Page The help page contains 3 main sections. 1 has the game instructions, 1 has the background for the creation of the game, and 1 has contact info in case there are issues with the game. ### Simon Page The simon section of the page, accessible with simon.shadeseeker.click, allows you to see a CSS styled Simon game as a sample. ### Other Features There is a menu that allows access to each of the pages off to the right of the game at all times.
